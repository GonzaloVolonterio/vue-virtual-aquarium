# Virtual Aquarium

# Challenge Description

Your task is to create a fun and functional Vue.js powered virtual aquarium.

## Requirements

- Display different types of fish in the aquarium (fish images provided in the public directory)
- Provide a form that allows users to:
  - Select a fish type
  - Give the fish a name
  - Add the fish to the aquarium
- Make added fish "swim" around the aquarium by moving their position
- Allow users to feed the fish. Each fish should have a hunger level that increases over time and resets when fed.
- Have fun with this and be as creative or minimal as you'd like.
